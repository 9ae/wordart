1. Javascript (jQuery, jQueryUI)  <br />
2. HTML5 <canvas> <br />
3. PHP <br />
4. <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">Google Web Fonts</a> <br />


III. Release Notes<br />This project went through several revisions

Version 1(December 2010): proof of concept, <canvas> alone.

Version 2(December 2011): computational photography revision. For the purpose to bringing on fancier fonts in, and also loading external images. AJAX functionality with PHP was added. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php">PHP's image processing library</a> was heavily used in this revision.

Version 3(April 2013): While v.2 introduced lots of cool features for big images my server's data transfer's limitations caused the AJAX calls to unexpectedly halt. I also discovered Google's Web Fonts at the same time. So in this version most of the PHP features were taken out. It can now draw text with fancier fonts by preloading the g-webfonts. I also revised the UI controls to make the task of generating "word art" picture simpler.

Version 3.5(June 2017): Fixed background rendering issues.
